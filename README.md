# Ultimate Dice Rolling Game ðŸŽ²

## Project Overview:
Welcome to the Ultimate Dice Rolling Game! This repository contains two versions of a dice-rolling game built with Python:
1. *Command-Line Version*: A simple text-based interface that lets players roll two dice, with a special bonus roll if double sixes are rolled.

## Features:
- *Roll the Dice*: Roll two dice and see your results.
- *Bonus Roll*: If you roll double sixes, youâ€™ll get an extra chance to roll!
